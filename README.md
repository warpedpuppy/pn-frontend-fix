How to start up the app
This app uses Parcel version 1.12.3

1. In your terminal, run "parcel src/index.html"
2. After a couple seconds the database will be started up

Description:
To build the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

My role for this project was to build a complete front-end and back-end web application using the MERN stack.
Some decisions I took on the back-end ended up hurting me when it came to naming databases. I would name a database in
a singular instead of a plurals. Example: Movie instead of Movies. This made me re-write the entire database and I realized I didn't pay to the fine details of how to properly write the database. The front-end part I tried to incorporate different components into one view, when I could just as easily create 2 different views to save time. Ended up creating 2 separate views for the user views.
